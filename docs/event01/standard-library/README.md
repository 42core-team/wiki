# 📊 Data Types

> Here you'll find the main data types and structures used in the game logic. These are essential for understanding how to interact with game elements, control units, and manage actions.

## Game and Configuration

### 🕹️ `typedef struct s_game {} t_game;`
Represents the entire game state, containing everything from status to teams, cores, resources, units, and actions.
> [!NOTE]
> This struct is globally accessable by just typing `game`

```c
typedef struct s_game
{
	t_status status;             	// Current game status (OK, Paused, End, etc.)
	unsigned long elapsed_ticks;	// The elapsed ticks since the game started.
	t_config config;            	// Game configuration (map size, teams, units, etc.)
	unsigned long my_team_id;    	// ID of your team
	t_team **teams;              	// Pointer to all teams in the game
	t_obj **cores;               	// Pointer to all cores
	t_obj **resources;           	// Pointer to all resources
	t_obj **units;               	// Pointer to all units
	t_actions actions;           	// List of actions (create, travel, attack)
} t_game;
```

> [!TIP]
> `t_game` is the central structure that stores everything happening in the game. Interacting with this structure gives you full access to game data like team status, units, and actions.

### 🗺️ `typedef struct s_config {} t_config;`
Represents the game's configuration, containing global settings like map size and team/unit configurations.

```c
typedef struct s_config
{
	unsigned long height;		// The height of the map.
	unsigned long width;		// The width of the map.
	unsigned long idle_income;	// How much idle income you get every second.
	unsigned long idle_income_timeout; // How many ticks you get idle income.
	unsigned long core_hp;		// How much healthpoints a core has at the start of the game.
	unsigned long resource_spawn_timeout;	// How many ticks new resources spawn.
	t_team_config *teams;	// List of all teams with their id and name. The array is terminated by an element with id 0.
	t_unit_config *units;	// List of all unit types that are available in the game. The array is terminated by an element
	t_resource_config *resources;	// List of all resource types that are available in the game. The array is terminated by an element with type_id 0.
} t_config;
```

## Objects

### 🧩 `typedef struct s_obj {} t_obj;`
Represents an object in the game, which could be a unit, core or resource.

```c
typedef struct s_obj
{
	t_obj_type type;                 // Object type (unit, core, or resource)
	t_obj_state state;               // Object state (uninitialized, alive or dead)
	void *data;                      // Your custom data - save anything you want here.

	unsigned long id;                // Unique identifier
	unsigned long x, y;              // Object's coordinates
	unsigned long hp;                // Object's health points

	union {                          // Type-specific details for cores or units
		struct {
			unsigned long team_id;   // Team identifier (for cores)
		} s_core;

		struct {
			unsigned long type_id;   // Unit type identifier (for units)
			unsigned long team_id;   // Team identifier (for units)
		} s_unit;
	};
} t_obj;
```

> [!TIP]
> - **Cores** belong to teams and are essential for the game's victory conditions (Your core has to be the last one alive to win the game).
> - **Units** can be of different types and have specific stats like HP and position.
> - **Resources** are critical for a team’s economic strength.
> - When working on `t_obj`s, it's recommended to ensure they are currently alive.
>	- They may be uninitialized immediately after creation, but the memory location will stay consistent forever.
>	- They will stay available after death for memory management purposes.
>	- If objects are not alive when you use them, behavior is undefined.



### 🔗 `typedef enum e_obj_type {} t_obj_type;`
Represents the types of objects in the game.

```c
typedef enum e_obj_type
{
	OBJ_UNIT,                    // A unit (e.g., warrior, worker)
	OBJ_CORE,                    // A core (the base of a team)
	OBJ_RESOURCE                 // A resource (e.g., minerals)
} t_obj_type;
```

### 🔗 `typedef enum e_obj_state {} t_obj_state;`
Represents the types of objects in the game.

```c
typedef enum e_obj_type
{
	STATE_UNINITIALIZED = 1,    // any data is still subject to change
	STATE_ALIVE = 2,            // default state. normal object.
	STATE_DEAD = 3              // dead unit / mined resource / ...
} t_obj_state;
```

### 🔗 `typedef enum e_status {} t_status;`
Represents the current state of the game.

```c
typedef enum e_status
{
	STATUS_OK = 0,				// The game is running
	STATUS_PAUSED = 1,			// The game is paused
	STATUS_END = 2,				// The game is over
	STATUS_WAIT_FOR_CLIENTS = 3	// The game is waiting for clients to connect.
} t_status;
```

## Units
### 🛠️ `typedef struct s_unit_config {} t_unit_config;`
Defines the configuration for units, including their stats and abilities.

```c
typedef struct s_unit_config
{
	char *name;                 // Name of the unit (e.g., "Warrior")
	t_unit_type type_id;        // Type of the unit (warrior, worker)
	unsigned long cost;         // Cost to create the unit
	unsigned long hp;           // Health points
	unsigned long dmg_core;     // Damage to cores
	unsigned long dmg_unit;     // Damage to other units
	unsigned long dmg_resource; // Damage to resources
	unsigned long max_range;    // Maximum attack range
	unsigned long min_range;    // Minimum attack range
	unsigned long speed;        // Unit movement speed
} t_unit_config;
```

> [!TIP]
> Units have specialized roles: some are better for attacking cores, while others excel at resource gathering or unit combat.

### ⚔️ `typedef enum e_unit_type {} t_unit_type;`
Defines the different types of units.

```c
typedef enum e_unit_type
{
	UNIT_WARRIOR = 1,           // Combat unit
	UNIT_WORKER = 2,            // Resource-gathering unit
	UNIT_TANK = 3,				// Big chonk
	UNIT_ARCHER = 4,			// Long distance pew pew
	UNIT_HEALER = 5				// Well.. he be healing
} t_unit_type;
```

## Resources

### 🌾 `typedef struct s_resource_config {} t_resource_config;`
Defines the configuration for resources, including their health and value.

```c
typedef struct s_resource_config
{
	unsigned long type_id;       // Resource type identifier
	unsigned long hp;            // Health points of the resource
	unsigned long balance_value; // Value added to the team’s balance when collected
} t_resource_config;
```

> [!TIP]
> Resources are vital for team economy, and their `balance_value` increases the team’s resource pool.

## Teams

### 🏴‍☠️ `typedef struct s_team_config {} t_team_config;`
Defines the configuration of a team, including its ID and name.

```c
typedef struct s_team_config
{
	unsigned long id;           // Team's unique identifier
	char *name;                 // Name of the team
} t_team_config;
```

### 🏅 `typedef struct s_team {} t_team;`
Represents a team in the game.

```c
typedef struct s_team
{
	unsigned long id;            // Unique identifier for the team
	unsigned long balance;       // Team's current balance (used for unit creation, etc.)
} t_team;
```

> [!TIP]
> Balance is crucial for determining whether you can create new units or take certain actions. (Or just spam spawn the units but keep in mind that it's better having a logic behind buying units)

## Action structs

### 💥 `typedef struct s_action_create {} t_action_create;`
Struct with every action that will be send to the server by the con lib

```c
typedef struct s_actions
{
	t_action_create *creates;
	unsigned int creates_count;
	t_action_travel *travels;

{
	unsigned long type_id;
} t_action_create;
```

### 💥 `typedef struct s_action_travel {} t_action_travel;`
Raw travel action struct that tells the server to move a unit to a specific pos if is_vector is false, otherwise in just the given direction.

```c
typedef struct s_action_travel
{

	long x;
	long y;
} t_action_travel;
```

### 💥 `typedef struct s_action_travel {} t_action_travel;`

} t_action_attack;
```
