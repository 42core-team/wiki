# **🌌 Units of the Wasteland**

In this barren world, where survival is the ultimate currency, only a handful of specialized individuals have risen to the challenge. Each unit carries the weight of its past and the hope of a better future—or at least the next meal. Meet the elite forces of the wasteland: the ones who fight, build, and heal in a world that has forgotten mercy.

> *"Where others see chaos, I see opportunity. My blade shall carve the future from the ruins of the past."*

The Warrior is the embodiment of raw strength and relentless determination. Forged in the fires of anarchy, these brave souls are the first to charge into battle, their armor pieced together from scavenged metal and shattered dreams. With every swing of their weapon, they remind the wasteland that survival isn’t given—it’s taken.

- **Role**: Frontline combatant and protector of allies.  
- **Strengths**: High durability and melee power.  
- **Backstory**: Warriors were once defenders of crumbled cities. Now, they wander the deserts, their hearts hardened as much as the steel they wield.

> *"Dig deep, dig fast. The earth holds the secrets we need, and I will uncover them before the vultures circle overhead."*

The Worker is the backbone of every clan, tirelessly extracting the precious remnants of resources from the earth. They are masters of improvisation, wielding makeshift tools and navigating treacherous terrain to unearth the lifeblood of survival—whether it's salt, scrap, or sustenance.

- **Role**: Resource gatherer and logistics expert.  
- **Strengths**: Efficient collection and supply chain maintenance.  
- **Backstory**: Once humble laborers, Workers became indispensable when resources dwindled. Without them, even the strongest armies would fall to hunger and despair.

# **⚡ Together, They Forge the Future**

> In a world where trust is a liability, these units form bonds stronger than steel. Each carries the weight of their past, but together, they are more than survivors—they are the architects of a new era.
