<div id="Functions" class="tabcontent"></div>

Those are all the functions currently available in the standart C lib for CORE.  
Fell free to use all the functions available!

> You can find the function implementations [here](https://github.com/42core-team/connection).

> **The power is yours!** Almost all of these functions are just helpful abstractions, but you can get anything you want yourself by filtering through all of the always-up-to-date data in the *game struct*.

# 🛠 Functions Overview

## ⚙️🔄 Init and Main Loop

### ⚙️ `void ft_init_con(char *team_name, int *argc, char **argv);`
Initializes the connection to the game server.
Pass your team name as the first parameter.

### ❌ `void ft_close_con();`
Closes the connection to the game server.

### 🔄 `int ft_loop(void (*ft_init_func)(void *ptr), void (*ft_user_loop)(void *ptr), void *ptr);`

# 📊 Data Types

> Here you'll find the main data types and structures used in the game logic. These are essential for understanding how to interact with game elements, control units, and manage actions.

## Objects

### 🧩 `typedef struct s_obj {} t_obj;`
Represents an object in the game, which could be a unit, core or resource.

```c
typedef struct s_obj
{
	t_obj_type type;                 // Object type (unit, core, or resource)
	t_obj_state state;               // Object state (uninitialized, alive or dead)
	void *data;                      // Your custom data - save anything you want here.

	unsigned long id;                // Unique identifier
	unsigned long x, y;              // Object's coordinates
	unsigned long hp;                // Object's health points

	union {                          // Type-specific details for cores or units
		struct {
			unsigned long team_id;   // Team identifier (for cores)
		} s_core;

		struct {
			unsigned long type_id;   // Unit type identifier (for units)
			unsigned long team_id;   // Team identifier (for units)
		} s_unit;
	};
} t_obj;
```

> [!TIP]
> - **Cores** belong to teams and are essential for the game's victory conditions (Your core has to be the last one alive to win the game).
> - **Units** can be of different types and have specific stats like HP and position.
> - **Resources** are critical for a team’s economic strength.
> - When working on `t_obj`s, it's recommended to ensure they are currently alive.
>	- They may be uninitialized immediately after creation, but the memory location will stay consistent forever. You can safely access their data field, state or type, but not their id, hp or coordinates.
>	- They will stay available after death for memory management purposes.
>	- If objects are not alive when you use them, behavior is undefined.

### 🔗 `typedef enum e_obj_type {} t_obj_type;`
Represents the types of objects in the game.

```c
typedef enum e_obj_type
{
	OBJ_UNIT,                    // A unit (e.g., warrior, worker)
	OBJ_CORE,                    // A core (the base of a team)
	OBJ_RESOURCE                 // A resource (e.g., minerals)
} t_obj_type;
```

### 🔗 `typedef enum e_obj_state {} t_obj_state;`
Represents the state of objects in the game.

```c
typedef enum e_obj_type
{
	STATE_UNINITIALIZED = 1,    // any data is still subject to change
	STATE_ALIVE = 2,            // default state. normal object.
	STATE_DEAD = 3              // dead unit / mined resource / ...
} t_obj_state;
```

### 🔗 `typedef enum e_status {} t_status;`
Represents the current status of the game.

```c
typedef enum e_status
{
	STATUS_OK = 0,				// The game is running
	STATUS_PAUSED = 1,			// The game is paused
	STATUS_END = 2,				// The game is over
	STATUS_WAIT_FOR_CLIENTS = 3	// The game is waiting for clients to connect.
} t_status;
```

## Game and Configuration

### 🕹️ `typedef struct s_game {} t_game;`
Represents the entire game state, containing everything from status to teams, cores, resources, units, and actions.
> [!NOTE]
> This struct is globally accessable by just typing `game`

```c
typedef struct s_game
{
	t_status status;             	// Current game status (OK, Paused, End, etc.)
	unsigned long elapsed_ticks;	// The elapsed ticks since the game started.
	t_config config;            	// Game configuration (map size, teams, units, etc.)
	unsigned long my_team_id;    	// ID of your team
	t_team **teams;              	// Pointer to all teams in the game
	t_obj **cores;               	// Pointer to all cores
	t_obj **resources;           	// Pointer to all resources
	t_obj **units;               	// Pointer to all units
	t_actions actions;           	// List of actions (create, travel, attack)
} t_game;
```

> [!TIP]
> `t_game` is the central structure that stores everything happening in the game. Interacting with this structure gives you full access to game data like team status, units, and actions.

### 🗺️ `typedef struct s_config {} t_config;`
Represents the game's configuration, containing global settings like map size and team/unit configurations.

```c
typedef struct s_config
{
	unsigned long height;		// The height of the map.
	unsigned long width;		// The width of the map.
	unsigned long idle_income;	// How much idle income you get every second.
	unsigned long idle_income_timeout; // How many ticks you get idle income.
	unsigned long core_hp;		// How much healthpoints a core has at the start of the game.
	unsigned long resource_spawn_timeout;	// How many ticks new resources spawn.
	t_team_config *teams;	// List of all teams with their id and name. The array is terminated by an element with id 0.
	t_unit_config *units;	// List of all unit types that are available in the game. The array is terminated by an element
	t_resource_config *resources;	// List of all resource types that are available in the game. The array is terminated by an element with type_id 0.
} t_config;
```

## Units
### 🛠️ `typedef struct s_unit_config {} t_unit_config;`
Defines the configuration for units, including their stats and abilities.

```c
typedef struct s_unit_config
{
	char *name;                 // Name of the unit (e.g., "Warrior")
	t_unit_type type_id;        // Type of the unit (warrior, worker)
	unsigned long cost;         // Cost to create the unit
	unsigned long hp;           // Health points
	unsigned long dmg_core;     // Damage to cores
	unsigned long dmg_unit;     // Damage to other units
	unsigned long dmg_resource; // Damage to resources
	unsigned long max_range;    // Maximum attack range
	unsigned long min_range;    // Minimum attack range
	unsigned long speed;        // Unit movement speed
} t_unit_config;
```

> [!TIP]
> Units have specialized roles: some are better for attacking cores, while others excel at resource gathering or unit combat.

### ⚔️ `typedef enum e_unit_type {} t_unit_type;`
Defines the different types of units.

```c
typedef enum e_unit_type
{
	UNIT_WARRIOR = 1,
	UNIT_WORKER = 2,
	UNIT_TANK = 3,
	UNIT_ARCHER = 4,
	UNIT_HEALER = 5
} t_unit_type;
```

## Resources

### 🌾 `typedef struct s_resource_config {} t_resource_config;`
Defines the configuration for resources, including their health and value.

```c
typedef struct s_resource_config
{
	unsigned long type_id;       // Resource type identifier
	unsigned long hp;            // Health points of the resource
	unsigned long balance_value; // Value added to the team’s balance when collected
} t_resource_config;
```

> [!TIP]
> Resources are vital for team economy, and their `balance_value` increases the team’s resource pool.

## Teams

### 🏴‍☠️ `typedef struct s_team_config {} t_team_config;`
Defines the configuration of a team, including its ID and name.

```c
typedef struct s_team_config
{
	unsigned long id;           // Team's unique identifier
	char *name;                 // Name of the team
} t_team_config;
```

### 🏅 `typedef struct s_team {} t_team;`
Represents a team in the game.

```c
typedef struct s_team
{
	unsigned long id;            // Unique identifier for the team
	unsigned long balance;       // Team's current money amount (used for unit creation, etc.)
} t_team;
```

> [!TIP]
> Balance is crucial for determining whether you can create new units or take certain actions. (Or just spam spawn the units but keep in mind that it's better having a logic behind buying units)
